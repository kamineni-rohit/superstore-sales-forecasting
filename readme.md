# Retail Sales Forecasting Using ARIMA & Exponential Smoothing

This project focuses on developing time series models to forecast monthly sales across retail product categories and regions using ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing. The insights support improved inventory planning, targeted marketing, and regional sales prioritization.

## 🧠 Objective
To build predictive time series models that assist in sales forecasting and inventory optimization across furniture, office supplies, and technology categories in various U.S. regions.

## 📦 Business Problems Addressed
1. **Sales Forecasting**: Monthly sales predictions to guide strategic retail decisions.
2. **Inventory Optimization**: Accurate category-level forecasts to avoid overstock and understock.
3. **Regional Prioritization**: Regional time series analysis to guide promotions and store strategy.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Dataset
- Sample Superstore dataset from Tableau
- 9,994 entries, 21 columns
- Aggregated into monthly sales for each product category and region

### Modeling Approach
- Performed stationarity checks and time series decomposition
- Applied ARIMA and SARIMA models with seasonal differencing
- Compared with Exponential Smoothing models (Winters Additive)
- Evaluated models using AIC, SBC, and MAPE

### Notable Insights
- Furniture and office supplies show strong seasonal trends
- Regional differences in growth and sales cycles observed
- Best ARIMA models achieved MAPE as low as ~19–24% for key categories and regions

## 📈 Results
- Category forecasts improve stock planning and warehouse efficiency
- Regional forecasts help align marketing and expansion strategies with demand patterns
- Sales peaks identified in June, September, and December

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SAS (for time series modeling)
- Tableau (dataset origin)
- ARIMA / SARIMA / Exponential Smoothing (ESM)
